🚀 On My Way to Learn Flutter
📱 What I Created

I built a Flutter Business Card App – a digital version of a personal business card.
Instead of worrying about carrying a physical card, anyone can now download my details as an app.
This project can also serve as a profile page template inside any Flutter app, with room for customization.

🛠️ What I Learned

Through this project, I explored the foundations of Flutter, including:

✅ Creating Stateless Widgets

✅ Understanding the difference between Hot Reload, Hot Restart, and Cold Run

✅ Using Containers to structure layouts

✅ Positioning UI elements with Columns and Rows

✅ Adding and customizing fonts

✅ Working with Material Icons

✅ Styling Text Widgets for better UI design

✅ Reading and applying knowledge from the Flutter Documentation

🌱 Next Steps

This is just the beginning! I’ll keep experimenting with new Flutter widgets, layouts, and animations as I level up my mobile development journey.
